                <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU), often referred to as the "brain" or "heart" of a computer, is the primary hardware component responsible for processing instructions and managing data within a computing system. It plays a central role in executing tasks and ensuring the functionality of the operating system and applications.</p>

                <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> Performs mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) and logical operations (e.g., AND, OR)</li>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Coordinates the activities of the CPU by decoding instructions and directing data flow between components.</li>
                <li><strong>Registers:</strong> High-speed storage locations within the CPU that temporarily hold data being processed.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Memory:</strong> A small, fast memory unit within the CPU that stores frequently accessed data to speed up operations.</li>

            <div class="cpu-description">
                <p>The speed at which a CPU operates is measured in hertz (Hz). The higher the hertz value of the processor, the faster it will be able to process instructions. This means that if you have a processor with a higher clock speed than another processor you will be able to perform tasks faster than someone with a lower clock speed processor. Clock speeds can range from 1GHz to 5GHz on modern processors.</p>
